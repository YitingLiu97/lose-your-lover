# Lose a Lover
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
Valentine's day is almost here. I wanted to make fun of the consumption of romance through my project. I used [Talk to Transformer](https://talktotransformer.com/) to generate texts based on my words.

# Notes & Process
I picked the swiss poster and analyzed the visual design in Figma. 


Here is my inspiration:
<!-- <img src="../assets/Swiss Poster.png"> -->

I then adapted the design using rulers and design tools to create the poster. Later, I used the CSS code from Figma to create a basic image of the poster on the website.

Since it is portait, I had to convert it to make sure it is responsive to the web. I used @media to make the restraint as the 700px.

<!-- ## Process & Documentation -->

<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
I was struggling with Javascript. The idea is simple. I wanted to change the color of the background as well as the red cropped squares based on the position of my mouse. However, I couldn't figure out how to make it work after spending 2 hours searching and watching online tutorials. I then focused on working on a simple button click to change the color of the origianl red cropped squares.

I made process in knowing the position of the mouse. However, when I try to incorporate the x and y value into rgb value for the object through its class name, it didn't work.

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
How to use onclick properly?
How to create subtracted shape? Right now, I created squares with two colors: red and white. The background is also white, so it appears to be subtracted but it isn't.
